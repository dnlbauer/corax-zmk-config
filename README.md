# Firmware for the Corax keyboard

This is the [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) firmware for the [Corax](https://github.com/dnlbauer/corax-keyboard).

Keymap optimised for US international.

## Corax56 vs Corax54

The Corax56 and Corax54 use the same shield.
The hardware of both keyboards is identical except the Corax54 is missing one key.
Therefore, you can use this ZMK config for both keyboards.
If you have a Corax54, just set the outer pinky key to `&none`
(basically, you can set it to whatever you want. It will be ignored).
